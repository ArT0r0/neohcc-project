# neohcc-project
This is the official website for the NeoHCC project and academic consortium.

NeoHCC is a global, multi-centre initiative investigating neoadjuvant immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Our academic consortium spans Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins, Mount Sinai, National Taiwan University and we are actively recruiting new sites and groups for our project.

The aim of this website is to inform the interested patients, public and potential collaborators of the study's progress accessibly; and to give a face to the researchers and clinicians working hard on the project.

Future functionality will include a path to accessing the project redcap (in development) to the aid of our current collaborators.

This is the first website I have built, and is therefore, continuously under improvement.
